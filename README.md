Dashboard test by Glaucia Marques


Instructions for a good operation :

1) Start the backend server by navigating to the backend folder and running "npm i", then "npm start";

If the server is working, it will display a message to the terminal saying "Server started on port 8000".

Server, ok? yes? so...Next stage!

2) Start the frontend by navigating to the front-dashboard folder and running "npm i", then "npm start";


Pendencies about the project:

- Graphics improvements are still needed;

- Making the buttons actually work, as well as your routes. 

- I wish I had made a sidebar.
